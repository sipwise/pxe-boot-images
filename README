NOTE: The current git pository tracks images/* files
using Git Large File Storage (LFS).

Please download and install Git command line extension
'git-lfs' to checkout code properly (mainly images/* files).
See 'Getting Started' section here https://git-lfs.github.com/

In short:
the content of images/* folder is stored on GitHub LFS directly
and checkouted/updated automatically using git-lfs extension.
The repository itself contains references to big files only
(altogether with their checksum).
